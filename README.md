# Django Setup

For this setup you may be intrested in fallowing this [page](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/windows/) instead.
I found the most sucsess using powershell but if you find CMD works for you go for it!

Start by seting up your virtual environment.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to replace the project Name with what you want the project to be called for the entirety of this guide.

```
py -3 -m venv Individual
```
Now you can activate the virtual environment
```
Individual\Scripts\activate
```

Now that the venv is active you can install django.
``` 
py -3 -m pip install Django
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> if that command doesnt seem to be working try
```
pip install Django
```

You may want to upgrade pip at this time.
```
py -3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

For Help on creating a project go [here](#Project-Setup)

To deactivate your virtual environment run Ctrl-C (if you have a django project running) then enter deactivate.

# Project Setup

Once you have django installed and your vertual environment running you can fallow these instuctions. Remember to change the project name to your own.
```
django-admin startproject Individual_project
```
If you want to be able to activate your project from the same place you controll your virual environment go ahead and do this. (I beleive this is optional just makes your life a little easier in the long run)
```
mv Individual_project/manage.py ./ 
mv Individual_project/Individual_project/* Individual_project
rm -r Individual_project/Individual_project/
```
You can run your server now with the command. Remember if you skiped the last step you will need to modify this command path for manage.py or navigate to the folder containing manage.py
```
python manage.py runserver
```
Now you Have started the server go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to se if its working. Use (on windows)ctrl+C to stop the server.

# Installing Bootstap

With the server deactivated but inside the environment run
```
pip install django_bootstrap5
```

# Change settings make app and edit app urls and views

There are several thing to change in Indvidula_project./settings.py

Include at the top
```
import os
```

change Installed_apps to

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
# ...
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
'django.contrib.sessions',
'django.contrib.messages',
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
# Add your app name here
'Website_app',
'django_bootstrap5'
]
```

and add
```
# Add support for authenticating users
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ['django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',]
```

at the bottom of the page after STATIC_URL include
```
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
]
MEDIA_URL = '/images/'
```

run in command line 
```
django-admin startapp Website_app
```

In Website_app/views.py

```
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
# Create your views here.
def index(request):
    # Render the HTML template index.html with the data in the context variable.
    return render(request, 'Website_app/index.html')
```

inside of Website_app/ create urls.py and put

```
from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
#path function defines a url pattern
#'' is empty to represent based path to app
# views.index is the function defined in views.py
# name='index' parameter is to dynamically create url
# example in html <a href="{% url 'index' %}">Home</a>.
path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

Next You will need to create a base template and index.html

Inside of Website_app make the folders

Template and inside that make a folder named Website_app

inside that folder make base_template.html and include
```
{% load static %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>UCCS CS Students</title>
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
{% load django_bootstrap5 %} 
{% bootstrap_css %}
{% bootstrap_javascript %}
</head>


<body>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-body-tertiary">
    <div class="container-fluid">
    <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" 
    data-bs-target="#navbarNav" aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"><span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span></button>
    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
    <ul class="navbar-nav">
    <li class="nav-item">
    <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'index' %}">Home</a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
    <a class="nav-link" href="#">Menu 2</a>
    </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    </div>
    </nav>


<!-- add block content from html template -->
{% block content %}


{% endblock %}
</body>
</html>
```

next make another page index.html

```
<!-- inherit from base.html -->
{% extends 'Website_app/base_template.html' %}


<!-- Replace block content in base_template.html -->
{% block content %}


{% endblock %}
```

# models

inside models.py
You can add any model you want in Individual_project we made a show model

```
from django.urls import reverse

# Create your models here.
class Show(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField()

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return self.title
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return reverse('show-detail', args = [str(self.id)])
    
```

title and description are feilds

__str__ and get_absolute_url will be used for linking to the url and displaying the name of the show.

if you need to view these models inside the admin make a [superuser](#making-a-superuser) and put this code into the admin.py

```
from .models import *

# Register your models here.

admin.site.register(Show)
```

any model you need to register just add a line replacing `Show` with the name of the model

# Making a superuser

inside the console run

```
python manage.py create super user
```
then fallow the instructions.
